# counting but it gets harder and harder

this was a discord bot inspired by the popular "counting" where people count numbers solely for the sake of "number go up"

One of my friends said, "hey what if it was counting but every time someone failed to count correctly, their channel slowmode would increase?"<br>
So thus, I set out to do this.
